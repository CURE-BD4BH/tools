# Introduction to the CURE-BD4BH project

The Big Data 4 Better Health (BD4BH) research project is funded by a five million dollar CURE grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. This three-year project started in 2015 and includes over 40 researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).

The overall goal of the project is to develop new machine learning methods that improve the analysis of the large amounts of data now being obtained on patients with cancer. The particular focus is on methods for better predicting cancer outcomes (e.g., the probability that a specific treatment will prevent cancer recurrence) using clinical data in combination with molecular data that have been gathered from a patient?s cells, such as gene-mutation data.

The project is exploring proof-of-principle approaches that are designed to lead to clinical trials. The main focus of the project is on breast and lung cancer; however, the methods developed are applicable to other forms of cancer, as well as other diseases.
